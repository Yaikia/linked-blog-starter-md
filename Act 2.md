They open the door, observe Figure & it runs away because of a sound caused by a blue light (Lana notices)
Lana tells them to be quiet, it can't see
Spark suggests they split up. They don't at first but do later
Kris finds a glowing book w Spark and see a shape marked with a number (aura)
Suzie finds the paper on the desk and she rummages through the drawers, Figure's near but she holds her pockets to stop the sound of the coins as she tiptoes away
Lana goes upstairs and checks on the lock and is attracted to another book.
Cliffhanger to the gang meeting up near the stairs. Kris starts to jog towards Lana, but her pockets end up making a sound (She was only making minimal movements at first that's why it didn't move) 
It attracts Figure and they all make a run for it (Spark & Kris to the cabinet, Lana upstairs and Suzie tip-toes out of there)

##### Chapter 4 - Figure pt. 2 (and Kris)
Spark tells Kris to hide in a closet as he distracts Figure. 
Kris asks "Are you sure?" Spark says something along the lines of "Can you trust me on this?" (latter half of the foreshadow,, the aftershadow)
Spark tries to make as much noise as he can, and probably just starts tearing the whole library apart behind him then he sees Figure is in front of the closet Kris is in, trying to open it
Spark wants to go back and save Kris but Lana is quick to stop him, telling him to prioritize finding the books with marks in it because it corresponded to the lock on the door upstairs
Spark asks "What about Kris?" and Lana says "It's what's best for all of us, just accept her noble sacrifice and make the most out of it." Spark is fucking baffled at her hypocrisy
Lana and Suzie find more books as Kris still distracts Figure (Probably lasts longer as Kris tries to completely be silent and hold the door shut) and Spark is just standing there
Kris finally makes it out, Figure sounds much more angrier and stomps louder as it lets go. Spark goes to her.
Suzie decodes it & Lana unlocks it, which Figure hears. 
As the doors opens and they escape, Spark can't help but not help Lana after she trips (potentially leaving Figure to kill her as the doors are also quickly closing)
She sees that but manages to escape and is like "Spark... wow" in her mind
Cliffhanger on nearby music & Spark-Lana tension

Synopsis: Kris has Figure trauma, Spark potentially wants to murder Lana, Suzie is just chilling cause she survived
